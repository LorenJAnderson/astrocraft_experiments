To generate data used for Table 2 in the paper, first clone the od2d and geo-patrol repositories. Place `od2d_generator.py` or `geo_patrol.py` in the repository where a random game is run (there should be an example of a random game). Running these two files generates four Python pickle files of data from each game. Use `visualizer.py` to get statistics and visualizations of the data.
